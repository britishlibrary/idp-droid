### Droid listing of IDP TIFFs generated by Julian Cook

For the listing (Droid Profiles) a few folders at a time see https://britishlibrary.github.io/idp-droid/droid_idp_tiffs_20230505

Droid software can be used to export these as CSV files. Warning: best done on a Mac - corruption occurs if open the profiles in Windows and attempt export there. 

I generated CSVs for Laurence using a Mac but those are NOT included in this repo since they are too large. They were sent using WeTransfer (?)


### Analysis of those Droid listings by Laurence Roger

See https://github.com/britishlibrary/idp-droid/issues/1 where there is a summary and a link to an Excel sheet. LR also has a larger Excel sheet she could send via WeTransfer.
